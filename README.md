# Full Court

## Client

<p>Full Court is a React-based app that allows users to display their fantasy basketball teams and post about their
    progress, and read posts from fellow users.</p>

## [Full Court Live App](https://full-court.vercel.app/)

<p>After registering, you can add players and posts to your My Team dashboard. Display the players that are on your team
    in your fantasy basketball league. Write posts about how your players and team are doing. On the League Stories
    page, read up on other teams from various fantasy basketball leagues to gain insight about how to improve your team
    in your own league!</p>

<p>As of this version (1.0.0), the app is situated somewhere between a blog and a social network. Future versions of the
    app will incorporate commenting,
    liking, and other features to nudge it closer to social network territory. Depending on availability, other player
    stats, fantasy stats, or league formats may also be incorporated.</p>

<p>This is the client side of the app, which was built with React. Context is used to manage state throughout. Knex
    connects this client with its server. Smoke testing and snapshot testing are also used inside the app.</p>

<p>This is a fullstack app using Heroku for server hosting and Vercel for client hosting.</p>
